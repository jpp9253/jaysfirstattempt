    <div class = "tips1">
        <p>You can practice self-care in many ways: exercise, eat well, meditate, seek therapy, and
            more. Each method of self-care fits into one of the seven pillars: mental, emotional,
            physical, environmental, spiritual, recreational, and social.</p>

        <p>Mental Self-Care involves creating a healthy mindset through mindfulness and curiosity.
                You can do this through journaling, meditation, or taking a break from screen time.</p>

        <p>Connecting with a friend when you're feeling lonely or sad can work mood-lifting
            miracles.</p>

        <p>After you’ve scrubbed with warm water, switch to cold for 30 seconds. You’ll get a big
            burst of energy as your body tries to conserve heat and kicks your circulation into gear.</p>

        <p>Be sure to constantly refill your water bottle every hour.</p>

        <p>Being in nature — especially in motion — boosts mood, sharpens thinking, and makes
            you feel calmer and more generous.</p>
